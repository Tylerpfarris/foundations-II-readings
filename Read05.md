## Problem Solving

### Mindset/ Attitude

- be open minded
  - things arnt always as they seem

- be inquisitive
  - look for things that seem odd or stand out, patterns, things that are out of place, anything missing?

- THE RIGHT QUESTIONS
  - what is it actually doing
  - how is it actually doing
  - what is its relationship with other components
  - what could i do to test the components

- SLOW DOWN
  - talk to yourself!

- look for pieces that stand out and approach the problem from there.

- look for the symptoms of the problem and try solving those.

- keep asking why until you get to the root of the problem.

### 3 keys to critical thinking

1) Question assumptions

    - figure out when to question assumptions

    - ask basic/ simple questions

    - consider alternatives to the present solution or mindset.

2) Reason through Logic

    - avoid post hoc thinking; becuase y followed x, y is the cause of x;

3) Seek out diversity of thought and collaboration

    - break out of my personal bubble and avoid group think. 

### Asking Great Questions

- follow-up questions act as a signal that you are listening, care and want to know more. 

- open-ended questions allow for a more organic response and avoids coercion.

- a questions posed with pessimistic assumptions tend to get a truthier answer.

- asking tough questions first can make people more willing to open up- but its a balance. 

- overly formal tone is likely to inhibit peoples willingness to share information.
