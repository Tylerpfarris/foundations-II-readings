# NODE.JS

- built on// usues Chrome's V8 JS engine

  - open-source, responsible for compiling JS directly to native machine code. 

  - Node.JS is a program we use to execute JS on our computers( JS runtime )

  - designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

  - Node.js is event driven and single threaded- meaning everything that happens in Node.js is reactionary.

  - Node.js is especially suited for apps that require real time interaction or collaboration(chat sites) also for building API's where youre handling lots of requests that are I/o driven or sites involving data streaming.

  - Node speaks JSON. JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JS program- meaning when youre working with NODE data can flow neatly between layers without need for reformating.
